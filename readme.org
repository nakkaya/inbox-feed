* inbox-feed

  inbox-feed is a tool for delivering news from RSS feeds to your email
  program. It is an attempt to add some features that are missing from
  other RSS to email applications.

** Configuration

   Following is the sample configuration, by default configuration file
   is *./config.clj* but you change its name and location using command
   line options.

   #+BEGIN_SRC clojure
     [:smtp-creds {:to "user@domain.com"}
     
      ;; :smtp-creds {:to "user@domain.com"
      ;;              :host "smtp.gmail.com"
      ;;              :user "user@gmail.com"
      ;;              :pass "super_secret_pass"
      ;;              :ssl :yes}
     
      ;; :imap-creds ["imaps" "imap.gmail.com" "nurullah@nakkaya.com" "super_secret_pass"]
      
      :feed-list [["http://news.ycombinator.com/rss" 15 "3cdbbd1e-5559-45d5-8dd6-d60408301580"]
                  ["http://www.reddit.com/r/programming/.rss" 15 "780e3966-547c-40a7-855b-23161ceee8d3"]
                  ;; when using IMAP
                  ;; ["http://news.ycombinator.com/rss" 15 ["feeds" "hackernews"]]
                  ]]
   #+END_SRC

   Above setup will inject mails to local sendmail process
   alternatively you can use an SMTP server or you can provide IMAP
   credentials then message will be placed in folder/s. *feed-list*
   is a list of vectors at the very least it should contain a list of
   feed URLs rest is optional. Having the following structure,

   #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
     [url freq id name]
   #+END_EXAMPLE

   - url - URL of the feed.
   - freq - Optional. How often we should check the URL (Defaults to 60 mins)
   - id - Optional string that will be appended to the email in *white*
     which allows you to create filters looking for that text or a
     vector of folder names defining a folder hierarchy entries should be
     placed in when using /IMAP/. ex. ["Feeds" "Feed"] will place the
     entries into the /Feed/ folder under /Feeds/ folder.
   - name - Optional name that will override the name for the feed.
